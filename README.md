# Investigating how ReLU-networks encode symmetries
Investigating how ReLU-networks encode symmetries; Georg BÃ¶kman and Fredrik Kahl; NeurIPS 2023. [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17017)

We provide notebooks illustrating how to merge a network with the horizontally flipped version of itself.
The code is based on the code from [REPAIR](https://github.com/KellerJordan/REPAIR/tree/master).
